## Who are we?

We are 750W, a team of dedicated robotics students enrolled in South Brunswick High School, which is located in Monmouth Junction, New Jersey. Our team consists of 13 members, representing a diverse range of backgrounds and skill sets.

Throughout the year, we participate in various robotics competitions, and also organize outreach events, where we share our love of technology with the community and inspire the next generation of engineers and scientists.

Our team has seen great success in recent years, winning multiple awards at regional and state competitions. Some of our notable achievements include winning the Excellence Award at Camden Tech Robotics Competition and qualifying for the VEX Robotics States Championship 2022 and CREATE U.S. Open Robotics Championship 2022 in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

In addition to our competitive achievements, we also place a strong emphasis on teamwork, collaboration, and learning. We believe that the skills and experiences gained through robotics extend far beyond the competition arena, and are beneficial for a career in any STEM field.
